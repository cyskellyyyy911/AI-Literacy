## Backend API (Node.js + MySQL)

The AI Impact Tracker uses a Node.js API backed by MySQL.

Setup:

1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. Create `config.js` in the project root with your DSN:

```
module.exports = {
  MYSQL_DSN: process.env.MYSQL_DSN || 'mysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname'
};
```

3. In the project root, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This starts the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

Frontend integration:

- The tracker loads from `/api/entries` (no localStorage fallback).
- Serve the frontend from the same origin, or configure a proxy for `/api/*` to `http://localhost:3000`.

Deploying the API:

- Host on any Node platform; set `MYSQL_DSN` as an environment variable.
